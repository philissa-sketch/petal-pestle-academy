// BOOK REPORTS AND RESEARCH PAPERS — THE WRITING THAT IS GRADED.
//
// ---- WHY THESE EXIST SEPARATELY FROM THE JOURNAL ----
//
// The Journal is never graded and never corrected. That is locked. But a record
// with no graded writing in it has no evidence of writing at all, which is a
// problem at a records review and a bigger problem for her.
//
// So the graded thing is a FINISHED PIECE SHE CHOSE TO MAKE, not the private
// page she writes on every day. She sees the rubric before she starts. Nothing
// here ever reaches back into the Journal.
//
// ---- HOW MANY, AND WHY NOT MORE ----
//
// FOUR book reports — one a quarter.
// TWO research papers — not four.
//
// The second number is deliberate. A research paper a nine-year-old abandons
// teaches her she cannot write one. Two finished papers beat four started ones,
// and the first is short on purpose.
//
// ---- THE READ-ALOUD RULE, AND WHY IT IS RECORDED ----
//
// TEN OF HER THIRTEEN Reading and Vocabulary questions on the Check-In were
// READ ALOUD to her. Her Reading 3.46 and Vocabulary 2.91 are LISTENING scores.
// Her independent reading is lower than both.
//
// That matters most here, because a book report requires reading a book. So
// read-aloud is ALLOWED and RECORDED, exactly as the Check-In records it.
// Hiding it would make the record wrong, and pretending she read alone when she
// did not would make the grade meaningless.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * HOW A RUBRIC MARK BECOMES A PERCENTAGE — AND WHY NOT BY DIVIDING BY FOUR.
 *
 * ---- WHAT THIS USED TO DO, FOR SEVENTEEN VERSIONS ----
 *
 *     percent = total / (rows × 4) × 100
 *
 * Four rows, all 3s — "meets the standard" on every single line — is 12 out of
 * 16, which is 75%, which on the ladder below is a C. All 2s was 50%: an F.
 * All 1s was 25%: also an F. THE BOTTOM TWO LEVELS OF A FOUR-LEVEL RUBRIC BOTH
 * COLLAPSED INTO FAILURE, and doing exactly what was asked came out average.
 *
 * ---- THIS IS A NAMED FAILURE MODE, NOT A MATTER OF TASTE ----
 *
 * BLUEPRINT_A_LOCAL_FIRST §3.6, on rubric scoreMapping:
 *
 *   "State how rubric levels map to whatever scale your records use, THEN CHECK
 *    THE MIDDLE OF THE RANGE. A rubric where 'meets the standard' lands on a
 *    failing percentage teaches the learner that meeting the standard is
 *    failure. This is a documented, recurring failure mode in rubric design,
 *    not a hypothetical — it happens whenever a 4-level rubric is divided by 4
 *    and mapped onto a percentage scale where 75% is a C."
 *
 * Divided by four. Mapped onto a scale where 75% is a C. Both halves, exactly.
 *
 * ---- THE LADDER, AND WHOSE IT IS ----
 *
 * Lamar settled this for Mission Control on Aug 13 2026, in PROJECT_LOG.md:
 *
 *   "The average maps 1->60, 2->73, 3->87, 4->100 rather than straight out of
 *    16, BECAUSE A RUBRIC THAT GRADES 'SOLID' AS A C TEACHES HIM THAT MEETING
 *    THE STANDARD IS FAILURE."
 *
 * The same four criteria carry across both apps, so the vocabulary carries too.
 * Now:  all 4s = 100 = A  ·  all 3s = 87 = B+  ·  all 2s = 73 = C  ·  all 1s = 60 = D-
 *
 * ---- WHY THE BOTTOM IS A D- AND NOT AN F ----
 *
 * Level 1 is the lowest DESCRIBED level of a rubric she was shown before she
 * started. It is work that exists, at the bottom of the scale — which is not
 * the same fact as work that was never handed in. The blueprint keeps those two
 * apart everywhere (§3.13.1: "a missing grade and a zero are opposite facts"),
 * and its own rubric mapToScale puts the bottom of a rubric at "introduced",
 * not at failed.
 *
 * So F is reserved for a piece that is not there. A piece that is there and
 * weak is a D-.
 *
 * ---- CONFIRMED BY GIGI, Aug 18 2026 ----
 *
 * Asked directly whether a bottom-marks piece should be an F or a D-, she chose
 * to keep Lamar's ladder as it stands: "Stays at Lamar's level." Both children
 * are marked on the same four criteria and now on the same scale, which is the
 * point of borrowing it.
 *
 * THE WAY BACK, so this does not become permanent by accident: change
 * RUBRIC_LEVEL_PERCENT[1] and invert the assertion in check-writing again, with
 * the new decision and its date written beside it. Never delete it.

   * FOUR WEEKLY STEPS. v3.82, and it is Lamar's shape.
   *
   * Gigi, Aug 25 2026: "Also, do the book report like Lamar's. Structured so she
   * will know what to do."
   *
   * ---- WHERE THIS COMES FROM ----
   *
   * His build log, Aug 2026, quoting the parent's own source:
   *
   *     "Break a single project down into tiny daily pieces instead of asking
   *      for a full paper at once... Write exactly one short paragraph per day.
   *      By Friday, he will easily have a full rough draft done without a single
   *      late-night writing session."
   *
   * And his diagnosis of the thing it fixed: "A Research Paper had been one task
   * with one date six weeks out — which for a 12-year-old means nothing happens
   * for five weeks and then a bad weekend."
   *
   * A book report worth 45 minutes, announced once and then left alone, is that
   * same bad weekend at nine years old.
   *
   * ---- ⚠️ WHAT COULD NOT BE COPIED, AND WHY ----
   *
   * HIS STEPS ARE DATED. They count backward from a real due date, one week
   * apart, the last landing ON it. THIS APP HAS NO CALENDAR AND REFUSES ONE —
   * five files say so, and §7.1's own words: "A quarter here means roughly nine
   * weeks. It is a sequence, not a set of dates. Anyone who treats these as
   * deadlines has turned a plan into a stick."
   *
   * So the mechanism is translated rather than copied: the steps pace on HER
   * PROGRESS, the way every other pacing decision in this app works. See
   * src/lib/bookReportSchedule.js.
   *
   * Copying the dates would have been §38 in a new place — a document about an
   * app is not the app, and neither is a mechanism lifted out of one that has
   * something this one deliberately does not.
   *
   * ---- ⚠️ EVERY STEP CARRIES A REAL INSTRUCTION, NEVER A LABEL ----
   *
   * His log again: "Steps carry real instructions, not labels... The
   * verification enforces a minimum instruction length so a future step can't
   * ship as a bare label." check-book-report asserts the same here.
   *
   * "Rough draft" tells a nine-year-old nothing. "One short paragraph a day,
   * and none of it has to be good yet" tells her exactly what tomorrow is.
