// SIX WAYS TO DO A BOOK REPORT — not one, four times a year.
//
// ---- WHY THIS EXISTS ----
//
// Gigi, Aug 25 2026: "do the book report like Lamar's."
//
// ⚠️ AND v3.82 BUILT IT FROM HIS NOTES INSTEAD OF HIS APP. `Lamar DOC` holds
// documents and no code, newest file Aug 16. His running app was mounted the
// whole time, with `reportFormats.js` updated Aug 25 at 22:05 — nine days
// newer — and nobody opened it.
//
// That is §38, committed in the version that quoted §38. A document about an
// app is not the app, and this time the app itself was sitting right there.
// Everything below is read off his code.
//
// ---- HIS REASON, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT ----
//
// reportFormats.js, his words:
//
//     "Five book reports and five presentations are scheduled this year, and
//      every one of them said only 'write a report.' SAME SHAPE FIVE TIMES IS
//      HOW A BOOK REPORT BECOMES A CHORE."
//
// Azianna has four a year and they were all identical. Same problem, one year
// younger.
//
// ---- WHY SIX AND NOT SIXTEEN ----
//
// He has 16. Several are his: Engineering Analysis is for aerospace design
// stories, Scientific Review is for nonfiction that makes claims, Podcast and
// Video need kit and an audience. Copying all sixteen so the table matched his
// would be the §35 mistake — a list that looks complete and aims at the wrong
// child.
//
// These six cover what a nine-year-old who wants to be a doctor and a herbalist
// will actually read: a story, a life, two things side by side, and two ways out
// of writing when writing is the wrong shape that week.
//
// ---- ⚠️ THE SIZES ARE HERS, NOT HIS ----
//
// His written formats run "5 paragraphs · about 350-500 words". THAT IS A
// TWELVE-YEAR-OLD'S REPORT. Her Grammar & Usage is 2.35 and her longest journal
// entry to date is eleven words. Copying his word counts would set her a target
// she cannot reach and call it a standard.
//
// Four short paragraphs, roughly 80-150 words, one a day across the draft week.
// It goes up as she does, and the number lives here where a check can read it.
//
// ---- AND EVERY WORD BELOW IS MEASURED ----
//
// check-book-report runs every section, checklist line and blurb through the
// app's own analyse() against her Quarter 1 cap. His prose is pitched at a
// seventh-grader; none of it is copied verbatim into something she reads.
