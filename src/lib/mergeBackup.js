// THE RULES FOR COMBINING TWO COPIES OF THE APP.
//
// Pulled out of db.js as pure functions for one reason: they are the part that
// can silently destroy something, and Dexie cannot be run outside a browser, so
// anything left inside db.js is untestable. A merge rule nobody can test is a
// merge rule nobody should trust with a child's only copy of her writing.
//
// ---- THE HAZARD, NAMED ----
//
// `answers` and `sittings` are keyed by an AUTO-INCREMENT id. Azianna's answer
// #12 on her laptop and a different answer #12 on her grandmother's are not the
// same event. Any merge that trusts that id will treat them as one row and lose
// one of them, and it will do it quietly.
//
// So the id is thrown away on import and rows are matched on what they actually
// are. An answer is (which question, when). A sitting is (when it started).
//
// The ledger and the journal never had this problem because their ids are
// UUIDs — chosen at the start precisely so two machines could merge. These
// tables predate that decision.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Which copy of a strand result to keep.
 *
 * The machine that actually sat the test is the authority for that strand. A
 * strand answered 8 times beats the same strand answered 0 times, every time,
 * regardless of which side is "local".
 *
 * ---- AND THAT RULE INVERTS DURING A RE-MEASURE. FOUND Aug 19. ----
 *
 * A re-measure STARTS THE COUNT OVER. So while one is running, the higher
 * `asked` belongs to the OLD reading, and "more answers wins" hands the merge to
 * the file that knows less.
 *
 * This was not hypothetical. Read off her two real files on Aug 19:
 *
 *   geometry          Aug 13: asked 8, settled, 2.00  |  Aug 18: asked 3, running, 2.70
 *   measurement-data  Aug 13: asked 7, settled, 2.00  |  Aug 18: asked 3, running, 2.70
 *   writing-strategies Aug 13: asked 7, settled, 2.45 |  Aug 18: asked 3, running, 2.70
 *   grammar-usage     Aug 13: asked 7, settled, 2.15  |  Aug 18: asked 4, running, 2.20
 *
 * Loading the Aug 13 file would have reverted ALL FOUR and re-flagged them
 * `settled: true` — which would also have let the goals engine set targets on
 * numbers that had just been thrown away. Geometry and Measurement would have
 * gone back to 2.00, the item-bank FLOOR that was never a measurement of her.
 *
 * So: A READING STILL BEING TAKEN BEATS A FINISHED OLDER ONE, whichever side it
 * is on and whatever the counts say. When both are running, or neither is, the
 * original rule stands and the count decides.
 *
 * ---- THE LIMIT OF THIS, SAID OUT LOUD (rule 17) ----
 *
 * `strandStates` carries no timestamp, so two half-finished re-measures on two
 * machines still fall back to the count, and the count cannot tell which was
 * started later. That case does not exist today — the re-measure runs on her
 * laptop only. THE WAY BACK: if a strand row ever carries a `lastAnsweredAt`,
 * prefer it over `asked` here and this whole branch becomes unnecessary.
 */
/**
 * Is `candidate` the SAME measurement as `base`, carried further?
 *
 * A re-measure serves specific items and records them in `seenItemIds`. If one
 * side has asked everything the other asked AND more, it is not a rival reading
 * — it is the same reading, continued. That is the only signal in this table
 * that can tell "later" from "different", because a strand row carries no
 * timestamp.
 *
 * The empty guard matters: a row with no `seenItemIds` is vacuously a subset of
 * everything, and would make every comparison a "continuation".
 */

/**
 * Which copy of a strand result to keep.
 *
 * ---- ⚠️ THIS WAS WRONG FOR ONE DAY AND IT NEARLY COST HER RE-MEASURE ----
 *
 * Aug 19, morning: `pickStrand` kept whichever side had the higher `asked`, and
 * a RE-MEASURE RESTARTS THE COUNT — so the Aug 13 file (geometry asked 8,
 * settled, 2.00) beat the in-progress Aug 18 reading (asked 3, 2.70). Loading
 * the old file would have reverted all four strands. The fix: an in-progress
 * reading beats a finished one.
 *
 * Aug 19, evening. Gigi: "she worked today." Azianna FINISHED the re-measure on
 * her laptop, so the incoming reading is asked 12 and SETTLED, and the local
 * one is still the half-done asked-3 stub. THE MORNING'S FIX THEN KEPT THE
 * STUB AND THREW AWAY THE COMPLETED MEASUREMENT — the exact loss it was written
 * to prevent, running in the opposite direction, twelve hours later.
 *
 * "In progress" was never the real signal. It is a proxy for "more recent", and
 * it is only a good proxy while the re-measure is unfinished.
 *
 * ---- THE SIGNAL THAT ACTUALLY WORKS: seenItemIds ----
 *
 * Read off her real files, geometry:
 *
 *   Aug 13 settled: ge-area-v2, ge-sides-v1, ge-sides-v0, ge-sides-v2,
 *                   ge-perim-v2, ge-perim-v0, ge-perim-v1, ge-area-v0
 *   Aug 18 running: ge-area-v1, fo-nameshape-v2, fo-sameshape-v0
 *
 * NOT ONE ITEM IN COMMON. The re-measure served easier items that had not
 * existed before, so the old file is plainly a DIFFERENT reading, not a later
 * one. But a file taken after she carries on today holds those same three ids
 * plus the rest — it is the SAME reading, continued, and it must win.
 *
 * So: continuation first, and only then the in-progress rule for the case where
 * the two sides share no history at all.
