// A BLOCK THAT NAMES A DIFFERENT COURSE ON DIFFERENT DAYS.
//
// Gigi, Aug 16 2026: "I will like social studies and the human body to be 2
// days a week. They can rotate ex. mon social studies, tues Human Body, etc."
//
// ---- WHY THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY EDITING THE BLOCK'S LABEL ----
//
// `DEFAULT_SCHEDULE` is ONE day template reused Monday through Friday. There is
// no Monday row and no Tuesday row. So no stored string can be correct on more
// than one day — a label saying "Social Studies" is wrong every Tuesday, and a
// label saying "Social Studies / The Human Body" is a slash list that tells her
// nothing about what today actually is.
//
// Her brother's app hit this exact wall and solved it the same way, in
// `src/lib/rotatingBlock.js`. His parent's words, from his log: "I dont
// understand the rotating block. Let's fix that to have the actual course that
// will be there for the week." A label listing everything a slot could be tells
// you nothing about what it is.
//
// So the label is RESOLVED AT RENDER TIME against the day being displayed.
//
// ---- WHY TWO DAYS A WEEK, AND WHAT IT COST ----
//
// `blk-science` carries a comment from v3.5 rejecting exactly this:
//
//     "Alternating by quarter rather than by day keeps the three-lessons-then-
//      a-review-day week intact for both. Alternating by day would give each
//      course two lessons a week and no week at all."
//
// That objection was real and Gigi has overruled it on purpose, so it is
// answered here rather than deleted. A two-day course now has a two-lesson week
// and a SHORTER Thursday test — five questions instead of eight — declared per
// course in `curriculumPlan.js` rather than assumed globally. The week shape did
// not break; it stopped being one-size-fits-all.
//
// What her rotation buys, and it is the reason it is worth the change:
//
//   * Social Studies drops from 96 lessons to 64. It was the largest single
//     body of unwritten work in the app.
//   * The Human Body stops sitting idle for half the year. It ran Q2 and Q4
//     only; it now appears every week of all four quarters.
//
// ---- ONE COURSE NOW ENDS BEFORE THE YEAR DOES (v3.31) ----
//
// Gigi, Aug 17 2026: "I would prefer the human body to have full year courses.
// Social Studies can have 2 qtrs or 1 if it doesn't really matter."
//
// The Human Body keeps Tuesday and Thursday every week of all four quarters.
// Social Studies runs Quarters 1 to 3 and then stops, so Monday and Wednesday
// have no course for the last eight teaching weeks.
//
// ---- AND THE APP CANNOT ASK WHICH QUARTER TODAY IS IN ----
//
// There is no date-to-quarter function anywhere in src/, and that is deliberate.
// catchUp.js states the reason: "The app does not map curriculum week 1 onto a
// date, and it should not: she is homeschooled, weeks get moved, and a schedule
// that scolds her for a family trip is a schedule she stops opening."
//
// So this file does NOT learn about the calendar. It uses the marker the app
// already trusts everywhere else — HER OWN PROGRESS. Monday and Wednesday hand
// to Social Studies for as long as it has a week she has not finished. When she
// has read every lesson of its last week, those two half-hours read open.
//
// That is self-correcting in both directions. If she runs long, the days stay
// hers until she is actually done. If she races ahead, the garden time arrives
// early because she earned it. Nothing needs a date to be right.
//
// ---- A COURSE WITH NO WEEKS HAS NOT RUN OUT ----
//
// Social Studies has zero lessons written today, so WEEKS.social does not
// exist. That is UNWRITTEN, which is a different thing from FINISHED, and
// conflating them would quietly delete the course from her timetable before a
// word of it was ever written. A course runs out only when it HAS weeks and she
// has read every lesson in all of them.
//
// ---- THE ONE RULE THIS FILE MUST NEVER BREAK ----
//
// If a grown-up has typed her own name for a block, HERS IS SHOWN, untouched.
// Same rule every migration in this app follows. The rotation renames a block
// the app owns; it does not overwrite something Gigi wrote.
