/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT — v3.78.
 *
 * ---- WHAT GEORGIA ASKS FOR ----
 *
 * O.C.G.A. § 20-2-690(c): a WRITTEN ANNUAL PROGRESS ASSESSMENT, covering each
 * of the five subjects the statute names — reading, language arts,
 * mathematics, social studies and science — kept on file for three years.
 *
 * The five are already mapped to this app's own subject ids in
 * `GEORGIA.requiredSubjects`, and `hoursSummary()` already returns
 * `perStatuteSubject` with a comment saying it exists "so the annual progress
 * report can be written against the five the law actually names". The
 * groundwork was laid for this file before this file existed.
 *
 * ---- BUILT THE WAY LAMAR'S IS, BECAUSE GIGI ASKED FOR THAT EXACTLY ----
 *
 * Mission Control's Report Card, from its own plan: "subject-by-subject LETTER
 * GRADES A-F, based on average accuracy on lessons actually attempted …
 * DELIBERATELY KEPT SEPARATE FROM CURRICULUM-COVERAGE STATS, since 'how much
 * of the curriculum exists so far' and 'how well he's doing' are different
 * things — plus a 'Needs Attention' list of specific weak lessons per subject,
 * printable, and a real downloadable transcript including the grade."
 *
 * And its screenshot shows the shape: ONE grade on the subject line, with an
 * "INSIDE THIS GRADE" breakdown under it, and the note "One grade goes on the
 * transcript. These two are what tell you where to spend the time."
 *
 * ---- ⚠️ THE ERROR THIS FILE EXISTS NOT TO REPEAT, AND GIGI FOUND IT ----
 *
 * His log records it: the Report Card showed "1/106 mastered · 1%" AS IF IT
 * WERE A GRADE — but that number measured how much of the curriculum had been
 * BUILT, "which I control by how fast I build it, not how well he's actually
 * doing". Conflating coverage with performance "made the platform's own
 * unfinished state look like his failure."
 *
 * A nine-year-old's record must never be marked down for a lesson nobody wrote
 * yet. So in this file COVERAGE AND HOURS CANNOT REACH THE GRADE. They are
 * returned beside it, in their own fields, and `check-annual-report` asserts
 * that changing coverage cannot move a single letter.
 *
 * ---- AND UNGRADED IS NOT ZERO ----
 *
 * Blueprint anti-pattern 23: "A missing grade averaged as a zero" → "ungraded
 * is a first-class state everywhere it appears (§3.13)". Lamar's does the same
 * thing in words: "A subject with zero attempts shows 'Not yet graded,' not a
 * misleading 0%."
 *
 * So `grade` is null with a written reason, never 0, and never an F.
 *
 * ---- ONE LADDER, ONE IMPLEMENTATION ----
 *
 * The percent-to-letter conversion is `letterForPercent` from khanGrade.js —
 * the ladder read off Lamar's real report card at v3.75. It is imported, never
 * restated. v3.70's rule: two implementations of one metric drift, and the day
 * they disagree neither number can be trusted.
