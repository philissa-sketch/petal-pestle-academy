// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT A BLOCK ON HER DAY ACTUALLY OPENS.
//
// The grandmother asked whether the schedule connected to the lessons. It did
// not. Each block named a subject and carried a note saying "Khan Academy — the
// unit on My Plan", which means: leave this screen, go to My Plan, find the
// right row, read the unit name, open Khan, find that unit. Six steps to start
// a thirty-minute maths block.
//
// A nine-year-old does not do six steps. She does the first one and then asks
// somebody, or she does something else. A timetable that names a subject
// without opening it is a poster, not a tool.
//
// So a block now resolves to a destination, and the destination is computed
// from HER OWN measured level — the same lookup My Plan uses, so the two can
// never disagree.
//
// ---- WHICH UNIT, WHEN A SUBJECT HAS SEVERAL STRANDS ----
//
// "Mathematics" covers five strands. Sending her to all five is not an answer.
// It sends her to the LOWEST one — the same priority rule My Plan sorts by,
// because the point of measuring was to find where to start.
//
// ---- WHERE THIS DELIBERATELY REFUSES TO GUESS ----
//
// Social Studies has no entry in the Khan map, because I have not yet checked
// what Khan actually offers at 4th-grade level — that is an open item, written
// down and owed. So this returns nothing for it, and the button does not
// appear. Sending a nine-year-old to a history unit written for a
// seventh-grader is worse than sending her nowhere: she opens it, hits a wall,
// and learns that her schedule lies to her.
//
// Science has a Khan course but no measured level, because Science was cut
// from the Check-In on purpose. So it links to the COURSE and says so, rather
// than inventing a unit from a level nobody measured.

 * ONE LESSON, NOT A COURSE INDEX. v3.79.
 *
 * Gigi, Aug 25 2026: "her today prompt just sends her to the lesson she is to
 * complete and she doesn't see the other lessons."
 *
 * Every one of the four courses this app teaches used to return
 * `{ kind: 'view', view: 'lessons', course }` — the course index. The v2.0 note
 * at the top of this file is about removing six steps from starting a maths
 * block; this removes the last one from starting an app-course block, and it is
 * the SAME correction the Khan side got at v3.20 ("her schedule opened a course
 * index, not her unit"). The app's own courses had been sitting on that bug for
 * fifty-nine versions, on the other side of the same file.
 *
 * ⚠️ `lessonsRead` IS NOT OPTIONAL FOR THIS TO BE RIGHT, and it is already
 * optional in the signature — a caller that omits it gets "she has done
 * nothing" and lands her on lesson one of ninety-six, for ever. check-links
 * already asserts TodayView passes it, for the label; check-lesson-gate now
 * asserts it for the target, because the cost of omitting it changed from a
 * wrong word to a wrong lesson.
 *
 * Falls back to the course index rather than returning null when the course has
 * no next lesson to give. A block that opens nothing is the dead end this file
 * exists to prevent, and every caller that could reach this line has already
 * handled "finished" above it.

 * because this function only ever received the block. So the block could say
 * "The Human Body" while the only thing that could decide what it opened was
 * looking at the string 'social'.
 *
