 * THE ONE PLACE THAT BUILDS A KHAN GRADE ROW.
 *
 * ---- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS — v3.74 ----
 *
 * Gigi, Aug 23 2026: "When she is in her Today's Planner it is supposed to
 * connect her to the unit she is working on in Khan Academy, but it is a new
 * week and the links still have the same units connected."
 *
 * The session that diagnosed it wrote down: "It is not a bug — it is a missing
 * manual step nobody knew was load-bearing." THAT DIAGNOSIS WAS WRONG, and
 * acting on it would have put a hint on the Planner telling Gigi to do
 * something that does not work.
 *
 * `nextUnitFor(courseId, grades)` counts a unit as done only when a grade row
 * carries BOTH `courseId` and `unitN`:
 *
 *     .filter((g) => g && g.courseId === courseId && Number.isFinite(Number(g.unitN)))
 *
 * `addKhanGrade` stored `{ subject, unit, percent, at, note }`. It stored
 * NEITHER of those two fields, and no other code path in this app has ever
 * written a Khan grade. So the form saved "math · Geometry · 82%", the
 * advancement logic looked for "math2 · unit 8", and the two could never meet.
 *
 * ⚠️ RECORDING A GRADE DID NOT ADVANCE HER, AND NEVER HAD. Her record holding
 * zero grades hid it: with nothing entered, a broken writer and a working one
 * look identical from the Planner.
 *
 * ---- AND THE CHECK THAT WAS MEANT TO GUARD IT PASSED, GREEN ----
 *
 * check-khan-units §6c walks Unit 1 to 8 and then the Course Challenge, and it
 * did that by pushing grade objects IT BUILT ITSELF:
 *
 *     grades.push({ courseId: 'math2', unitN: i });
 *
 * A shape the app has never once produced. The check was testing
 * `nextUnitFor` in isolation and printing "advance one unit per grade", which
 * is a claim about the APP. Rule 4: a check must never claim more than it
 * tests. That check's own comment at §6b confesses to this exact failure one
 * section higher — "it asserted the block opens an exact unit and never once
 * asked WHICH" — and then it happened again, immediately below.
 *
 * ---- SO THE SHAPING MOVED OUT OF THE STORE ----
 *
 * Rule 11: a rule the app must follow lives in the ENGINE or a lib, where a
 * check can test it. `addKhanGrade` is a zustand action that writes to
 * IndexedDB; no check in Node can call it. This function is pure, so
 * `check-khan-advance` can put a grade through THE APP'S OWN WRITER and hand
 * the result straight to `nextUnitFor` — a round trip, not a rehearsal.
 *
 * check-khan-advance also asserts that the store still calls this and does not
 * go back to hand-building a row, because that is how the field went missing.
 *
 * ---- WHAT IT WILL NOT DO ----
 *
 * It will not guess a unit from free text. The pre-v3.20 grades were typed as
 * prose and matching them by string would quietly mark the WRONG unit
 * complete — a unit she never sat, marked done, on a record that becomes a
 * transcript. An unrecognised course or unit is refused with words, and the
 * old rows already on her record stay ignored exactly as they were.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LAMAR'S KHAN LADDER — v3.74, and it is HIS, read off HIS disk.
 *
 * Gigi, Aug 24: "I want the grading to be exactly like Lamar's."
 *
 * ⚠️ AND IT IS NOT THE LADDER THIS APP ALREADY CALLS LAMAR'S. `RUBRIC_BANDS`
 * in writingPieces.js is a twelve-band percent ladder — A 93, A- 90, B+ 87,
 * down to D- 60 — and its comment calls it "Lamar's +/- ladder". That is the
 * ladder his WRITING rubric uses. HIS KHAN GRADING IS A DIFFERENT THING, and
 * copying the writing ladder onto Khan would have been the wrong answer given
 * confidently.
 *
 * Read on disk in Lamar DOC/docs, twice, in two files that agree:
 *
 *   PROJECT_LOG.md — "a Mark Complete button that reveals an inline A-F grade
 *   picker (A/A-/B+/B/C/D/F, per the rubric worked out earlier: Mastered=A,
 *   Proficient=A-/B+, Familiar 90-99%=B, Familiar 70-89%=C, below 70%=D)"
 *
 *   PROJECT_PLAN.md — "an inline A-F grade the parent assigns based on what
 *   Khan Academy shows on screen after the exercise"
 *
 * ⚠️ THAT FOLDER NO LONGER EXISTS — Gigi deleted it Aug 26 2026, so the two
 * quotations above can no longer be re-checked against their source. They are
 * kept verbatim because that is what a citation is for, and because this whole
 * block is already marked SUPERSEDED below.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND HIS APP HAS MOVED PAST THEM ANYWAY. Checked against his running code
 * on Aug 26 2026: gradeScale.js takes a percentage or a fraction and derives
 * the letter. His own note calls the mastery-word route "three lossy steps,
 * done 151 times across the year, each one a chance to grade the same
 * performance two different ways in October and March." NOTHING IN HIS src/
 * MAPS Proficient OR Familiar TO A LETTER ANY MORE.
 *
 * So KHAN_MASTERY_GUIDE stays as a FALLBACK, for the screens where Khan shows a
 * word and no fraction — and it is no longer claimed to match what his app does
 * today. The fraction is the normal path in both apps now.
 *
 * ⚠️ SUPERSEDED THE SAME DAY BY THE BLOCK BELOW — KEPT, NOT DELETED.
 *
 * v3.74 concluded from those two quotes that Khan grading is A PICKER AND NOT
 * A PERCENT BOX, and that "the app never computes the letter". Gigi corrected
 * it within the hour: "Khan Academy scores with fractions. When the fraction
 * is entered by me the app turns it into percentages and letter grades."
 *
 * BOTH HALVES OF THAT REASONING WERE WRONG, AND FOR ONE REASON: the quotes
 * describe his Khan MISSION CARD, which grades a skill off a mastery word.
 * They say nothing about a unit test, which prints a fraction. A quote read
 * accurately can still be evidence for the wrong claim.
 *
 * The rule the app now follows: SHE TYPES THE FRACTION, THE APP DOES THE
 * ARITHMETIC. That is not the app inventing a number — she supplies both
 * numbers off Khan's screen and division is not a judgement. What the app
 * still must never do is produce a score with no input from her.
 *
 * The mastery-word mapping survives as the FALLBACK, for the skills that show
 * a word and no fraction. See KHAN_MASTERY_GUIDE below.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ⚠️ CORRECTED v3.75 — THE DOCS ON LAMAR'S DISK ARE BEHIND HIS RUNNING APP.
 *
 * v3.74 read PROJECT_LOG.md and reported his report-card scale as five bands:
 * "A 90-100, B 80-89, C 70-79, D 60-69, F below 60". Gigi then sent a
 * SCREENSHOT OF THE ACTUAL REPORT CARD, which shows:
 *
 *      Mathematics            B    86% avg
 *      English Language Arts  A    93% avg
 *      Reading & Literature   A+   99%
 *      Grammar & Writing      B    86%
 *      Science                B-   82% avg
 *
 * A+ and B- do not exist on a five-band scale. Every one of those five points
 * fits the PLUS/MINUS ladder instead, and only that ladder: 86 is a B because
 * B+ starts at 87; 82 is a B- because B starts at 83.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE LESSON, AND IT IS THE PROJECT'S OWN RULE ARRIVING FROM A NEW
 * DIRECTION: "verify against the disk, not against what I tell you — and not
 * against the app's own comments either." A DOCUMENT ABOUT AN APP IS NOT THE
 * APP. Lamar's folder is docs only, no code, so the newest thing in it is
 * still older than the screen. v3.74 stated his scale as a fact, in a build
 * log, from a file — and the running app disagreed.
 *
 * SO THIS LADDER IS DERIVED FROM THE SCREEN, and its provenance says so.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE BAND IS ASSUMED AND IS MARKED AS ASSUMED. The screenshot proves A+
 * exists and that 99 earns it. It does not say where A+ starts. 97 is the
 * ordinary threshold and it is what is used here, so it affects marks of 97,
 * 98 and 99 and nothing else. NOT CONFIRMED AGAINST LAMAR'S APP. Ask before
 * it reaches a transcript.
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------- */

 * which made an absent result an F, and made an ungraded unit drag a course
 * average down as though she had sat it and got nothing.
 *
 * Caught by check-khan-advance on its first run, three times over. §3.6's rule

 * whole course, and Khan offers it separately — her 2nd Grade Math screenshot
 * shows it sitting under Unit 8 with its own "Resume Course challenge" link,
 * already in progress.
 *
 * They are not the same measurement and must never be added together:
 *
 *   · averaging a cumulative final in with eight unit tests counts the same
 *     material twice and quietly weights the whole course toward one sitting;
 *   · and a Course Challenge result landing on a unit row would mark a unit
 *     she never sat as DONE, which is the exact thing the pre-v3.20 free-text
 *     rows are refused for.
 *
 * So the kind is stored, and everything that walks units filters BY KIND

/**
 * ONE BOX. A fraction or a percentage, whichever Khan is showing her. v3.84.
 *
 * ---- WHY THIS EXISTS ----
 *
 * Gigi, Aug 26 2026: "i want the format the same. when putting in a fraction
 * for kahn academy the learning app converts the fraction to a percentage and
 * letter grade."
 *
 * v3.75 already converted a fraction — but through TWO little number boxes, one
 * for 8 and one for 10. His takes ONE text box and works out which shape it is.
 * His parser, `parseScore` in src/lib/gradeScale.js, read off his running app
 * on Aug 26.
 *
 * ---- AND ONE BOX IS NOT A COSMETIC DIFFERENCE ----
 *
 * Khan does not print a constant denominator. His note: "Khan's progress page
 * reports a unit test as 9/11, 8/10, 4/6 — a fraction, and the denominator is
 * not even constant between units." Two boxes make her decide which number goes
 * where, 151 times a year. One box takes what is on the screen in front of her.
 *
 * It also takes a plain percentage, because a Course Challenge and a mastery
 * screen sometimes give one, and making her convert it back into a fraction to
 * fit the form would be the same lossy step in the other direction.
 *
 * ---- WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES ----
 *
 * His rejects, kept exactly: blank, 'abc', -5, 120, '12/10' (more right than
 * there were), 'x/0'. His reason, which is the right one: "An out-of-range
 * number is a typo, and silently clamping it to 100 would record a grade she
 * did not mean."
 *
 * Returns { percent, raw, correct, total } or null. `raw` keeps the fraction as
 * she typed it — v3.75's rule: keep what she observed, compute the conclusion
 * every time it is shown, so a total can never quietly disagree with what it
 * came from. A percentage typed straight in has raw null, because there was no
