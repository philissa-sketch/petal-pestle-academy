 *
 * ---- WHY IT SENDS A NOTE RATHER THAN INVENTING A CHANNEL ----
 *
 * The app already has "Notes from Gigi and Mom", with a sender picker, a read
 * receipt, a place on her Home screen and a row in the backup. A second, nearly
 * identical delivery path would mean a new table, a database version, an export
 * change and an import change — four places to get wrong — to do a thing that
 * is already built. So the note goes where every other note from home goes, and
 * arrives looking like one, because that is what it is.
 *
 * ---- ON THE AI QUESTION ----
 *
 * There is no model here and no network call. Gigi asked to see this version
 * first. If a model is ever added it can only write a DRAFT into this same box
 * for her to edit and send — a grown-up stays between the machine and the child,
 * and the entry itself is still never scored.

 *
 * Lamar's Mission Control does not have a form. `KhanAcademyMissionsCard.jsx`
 * shows EACH SKILL AS ITS OWN ROW with a verified link, a Mark Complete
 * button, and an inline A-F picker revealed beside it. Nothing is chosen from
 * a list before you can record anything — the work is already on the screen

 * So this is rows. Every unit of every course Azianna is in, in order, each
 * one showing whether it has been recorded and offering the picker if it has
 * not. The unit she is on right now is marked, because that is the one the
 * question is usually about.
 *
 * ---- WHY THIS REPLACED A FORM WITH A PERCENT BOX ----
 *
 * The old panel asked for a subject from a dropdown and a unit typed as free
 * text, and stored a percent. Three things wrong with that at once:
 *
 *   · the typed unit could not be matched to a real unit, so recording a grade
 *     never advanced her — the whole v3.74 bug;
 *   · the subject could be chosen separately from the unit, so the two could
 *     disagree about the same row;
 *   · and Khan does not show a percent on the screen Gigi is reading. It shows
 *     Mastered, Proficient, Familiar. Asking for a number she has to derive is
 *     asking her to do arithmetic that Lamar's app never asked for.

             It read: "a note written here will never reach her. To send her

             Gigi: "I left a message on her journals. Where would she see them?"
             The answer was nowhere — but not for the reason the screen gave.
             THE MECHANISM ALREADY WORKED: exportAll ships messages,
             importBackup merges them, and a fresh note arrives on a machine
             that has never seen it. Nobody had ever used it in that direction,
             so the screen described the habit as though it were a limit.

             A screen that tells a grown-up the app CANNOT do something it can
             is the same class of error as one that claims a thing is not
             recorded when it is — it just costs her a feature instead of the
             truth. ---- */}
