// HER COURSE, END TO END.
//
// Every module is a FORTNIGHT — two weeks — and the quarter exam opens when all
// eight weekly tests in that quarter are behind her.
//
// ---- HOW MANY LESSONS ARE IN A WEEK DEPENDS ON THE COURSE ----
//
// This comment used to read "eight modules, each week is three lessons", which
// was true when the app held one course and stopped being true at v3.22. It is
// written out properly now, because a stale comment is where a wrong plan comes
// from (v3.41, where three separate documents described a layout that had never
// existed).
//
//   Herbalism      3 days a week → 3 lessons a week → 6 to a module
//   The Science Lab 3 days a week → 3 lessons a week → 6 to a module
//   Social Studies  2 days a week → 2 lessons a week → 4 to a module
//   The Human Body  2 days a week → 2 lessons a week → 4 to a module
//
// The two-day courses are two-day BY GIGI'S DECISION, not by omission: they
// share the 2:45 block and rotate, Social Studies on Mon/Wed and The Human Body
// on Tue/Thu. A week card showing two lessons is that decision on the screen.
// The count next to the module heading is the module's own — 4, not 2.
//
// ---- WHY EVERYTHING IS ON ONE SCREEN ----
//
// Lessons in one place and tests in another would mean a test is something that
// arrives, rather than the obvious next step after the lessons it covers. Here
// the test sits at the bottom of its own unit, greyed out until the lessons
// above it are read, saying exactly which ones are still missing.
//
// ---- WHAT IS LOCKED, AND WHY EACH LOCK EXISTS ----
//
// * A weekly test needs its lessons read. Otherwise it is a trick question.
// * A quarter exam needs all eight weekly tests sat. It is cumulative; sitting it
//   early would measure material she has not been through.
// * A re-take waits two days. That one is the least obvious and the most
//   important — see retakeStatus in lib/assessmentEngine.js.
//
// None of these are locks on HER. Every one of them can be explained in a
// sentence on screen, and every one of them is on screen.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// ---- WHY THERE IS A COURSE SWITCHER, v3.25 ----
//
// This screen used to name Herbalism in its own heading and render
// HERBALISM_MODULES directly. That was honest while Herbalism was the only
// course the app taught itself.
//
// It stopped being honest at v3.24, when six Science Lab lessons were written
// and there was no way to open one. The course existed on disk, passed its own
// check, was recorded as shipped — and its only appearance anywhere in
// src/components was a microscope emoji beside its name on the year plan.
//
// So the screen asks appCourses.js what courses there are. A course added there
// appears here; a course NOT added there is invisible, which is the failure this
// exists because of, and check-delivery fails the build on it.
