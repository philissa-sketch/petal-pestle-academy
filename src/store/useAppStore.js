   * would have offered Unit 1 for ever no matter how much work she did.
   *
   * The shaping lives in `src/lib/khanGrade.js` now so `check-khan-advance`

   * A store action cannot be called from a check; a pure function can.

   *
   * Tests already keep their working: an attempt row holds every question,
   * what she picked, and whether it was right. The audit said otherwise and
   * Batch A was sized on that; reading the code corrected it.
   *
   * The warm-up was the real hole. Three questions every morning, and the only

   * not whether she needed a second go. And it is the STRONGEST evidence in

   * re-take is a different paper. See reopenStrandState() in the engine for why
   * that list used to be cleared and why clearing it was wrong.

   * Her ANSWER HISTORY is untouched. The old attempt stays in the record, which
